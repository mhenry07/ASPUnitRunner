# ASPUnitRunner

ASPUnitRunner is a library to allow running ASPUnit tests for classic ASP from NUnit.

Basically, it is an alternative to running ASPUnit tests from a web browser and could theoretically be used to allow running tests from a continuous integration server.

ASPUnit is an xUnit framework for classic ASP/VBScript. See <http://aspunit.sourceforge.net/>. There is no direct affiliation between ASPUnitRunner and ASPUnit.
